            In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes
            in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation,
            etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that
            together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.

<br>
<b>Class </b>
A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created.
 It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods. 

 <br>
<b>Objects</b>
The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. It may be any real-world object like a mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc. Integers, strings, floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries, are all objects.

 <br>
<b>Inheritance</b>
Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The class that derives properties is called the derived class or child class and the class from which the properties are being derived is called the base class or parent class
 <br>
 <b>Polymorphism</b>
Polymorphism simply means having many forms. For example, we need to determine if the given species of birds fly or not, using polymorphism we can do this using a single function.

 <br>
 <b>Encapsulation</b>
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method.

 <br>
 <b>Data Abstraction </b>
It hides the unnecessary code details from the user. Also,  when we do not want to give out sensitive parts of our code implementation and this is where data abstraction came.
Data Abstraction in Python can be achieved through creating abstract classes.

        <b>Java - What is OOP?</b>
        <pre>
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
